* Data Set Name: Reproduction Child-healthcare Classification
*	Data set Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reproductive-childhealthcare-classification
a)	This dataset contains over 2000 records of about 21 features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams. This is further classified into 3 classes:
i.	Normal
ii.	Suspect
iii.	Pathological
The most common class of fetal-health is being Normal (about 82% data), followed by suspect (15% data) and in rare cases (1.5%) chances of being Pathological.
b)	Thus, with large difference in no of rows of different output class, oversampling is done.
c)	The main algorithm used in the project include Decision Tree (Accuracy:0.82), Random Forest (Accuracy: 0.87), Naïve Bayes (Accuracy:0.81) and XGBoost (Accuracy:0.84)
* So, the following are algorithm implemented along with their accuracy, 
•	Decision Tree (Accuracy:0.82)
•	Random Forest (Accuracy: 0.87)
•	 Naïve Bayes (Accuracy:0.81) 
•	 XGBoost (Accuracy:0.84)
